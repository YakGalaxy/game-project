# WINDRONE 95

Welcome to **WINDRONE 95**, a retro-style game inspired by the simplicity and charm of MS DOS interfaces and 8-bit gaming. Navigate through the bustling aerial highways of a retro-futuristic city, piloting your drone while avoiding traffic to stay below your Traffic Accident Quota (TAQ).

## About The Game

**WINDRONE 95** takes you back in time with its pixel art graphics and nostalgic sound effects, emulating the classic gaming era. As a drone pilot, your task is to navigate through increasingly busy skies, managing your TAQ. Each collision reduces your available drones (lives); run out of drones, and it's game over!

### Features

- **Retro Aesthetics**: Enjoy graphics and sound effects designed to mimic the MS DOS era.
- **Increasing Difficulty**: As you progress, the skies get busier and the challenge grows.
- **Score Tracking**: Compete against yourself and others by keeping your TAQ as low as possible.
