The .mod version of each song was created for and is compatible with openMPT software (https://openmpt.org/).
The song was made using the limitations laid out by GB Studio (see https://www.gbstudio.dev/docs/music-gbt/)
and should be able to run a .mod file as-is when placed in the 'music' subfolder of a GB Studio project's 'assets'.
GB Studio can be downloaded at https://chrismaltby.itch.io/gb-studio.

The mp3 or wav version is also provided, although OpenMPT is able to export the .mod file into other formats if needed.
As noted in the GBStudio dev docs, the song as played in OpenMPT or the mp3/wav format may sound different than GBStudio software.
The .mod version of the song can be edited at the individual note/volume/effect level if needed.

22-Oct-2023: Although there are not .uge conversions for these songs yet, you can try exporting them to hUGETracker and get them to .uge with some tweaking
